# Auto-ETF-Backtesting-Forecasting-Platform: Automated ETF Analysis, Forecasting & Strategy Simulation

**Auto-ETF-Backtesting-Forecasting-Platform** is a fully automated Python-based pipeline for ETF strategy simulation, performance analytics, and short-term forecasting.

It integrates live ETF data collection via custom web crawlers, automated data synchronization to Google Sheets, and configurable investment simulations driven by flexible Python scripts. The system supports real-time strategy testing, comprehensive metric evaluation (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown), and statistical forecasting using Prophet.

Additionally, an interactive front-end interface allows users to select ETFs, adjust parameters (e.g., start/end date, investment amount, frequency), and visualize results with dynamic plots, making this tool ideal for both analysis and demonstration.
